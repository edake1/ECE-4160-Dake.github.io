# LAB 4: Motors and Open Loop Control
This purpose of this lab is to equip the robot with time of flight sensors to enable it judge distances accurately in order to avoid running into obstacles and perform stunts. 

<b>PARTS REQUIRED</b> 
- 1 x SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano
- 2 x Dual motor drivers
- 1 x USB C-to-C or A-to-C cable
- 2 x 4m Time of Flight Sensors
- 1 x QWIIC Breakout board
- 2 x QWIIC connectors
- 1 x Li-Ion 3.7V 850mAh battery

## The Motor Drivers

### Wiring diagram  
As can be seen from the wiring diagram below, instead of driving both motors with the two inputs and outputs, we decided to parallel-couple the inputs and outputs on each motor driver and power them separately. By doing this, we are able to deliver twice the average current without running the risk of overheating the chip thus enabling our robot to run faster than it would have if powered on single channels instead.

Per the wiring diagram, I soldered the appropriate inputs and outputs to achieve power-coupling before soldering the connections to the motors. I ran one motor driver with pins 6 and 7 on the Artemis board and another with pins 12, and 13. These pins were chosen because they support sending PWM signals via AnalogWrite commands from the Artemis to the motors. 

### Powering Motor Drivers - Battery considerations 
As depicted in the wiring diagram above, we opted to power both motor drivers and motors using a 3.7V Li-Ion battery distinct from the one used to power the Artemis. This decision stemmed from several considerations, primarily aimed at ensuring the isolation of power systems.

The choice for separate power sources was driven by the potential for electrical or electromagnetic noise generated by the motors, which could lead to interference with the Artemis. Additionally, motors typically necessitate higher voltage and current requirements compared to the Artemis, and they may draw substantial currents, especially during start-up or under high load conditions. By isolating the power systems, we mitigated the risk of such fluctuations impacting the Artemis's power needs and overall operation.

## Motors 
### Testing 
To activate each motor, I employed PWM signals to instruct them to start rotating. By designating one pin as high and the other as low, I controlled the direction of rotation. In the provided code snippet, I specifically set PIN_6 to a value of 130 (out of 255) and PIN_7 to 0 using the analogWrite command. This configuration initiated the motor's rotation. By swapping the PWM values, I could alter the direction of the wheels, enabling both forward and backward motion.

#### Code snippet for running one set of wheels
```
...
if (motor_run){
  if (pwm_37_left_forward){
    Serial.println("6 and 7");
    analogWrite(PIN_6, 130);
    analogWrite(PIN_7, 0);
  }
  else if (pwm_37_left_backward){
      analogWrite(PIN_7, 130); 
      analogWrite(PIN_6, 0); 
  }
...
```
