# LAB 8: Stunts 
The purpose of this lab is to combine everything we have done so far to perform stunts with the robot. 

## Trial 1 - Toward the wall and back
For the stunt, I opted to program my robot to sprint towards a wall, execute a swift turn, and then retrace its path back in the opposite direction.
